I wanted to provide you with an update regarding the ongoing poultry trials involving our Flufence™ system.\n\nCurrently, the results from these trials are still being analysed, and we appreciate your interest and patience as we work through this important phase. At this time, we cannot make performance claims yet, as we need to ensure the data is fully vetted and approved.\n\nThank you for your understanding. We will keep you informed as we progress and have more information to share.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]  \n[Your Position]  \nIlimex Ltd  "
