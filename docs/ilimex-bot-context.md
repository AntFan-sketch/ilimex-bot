## 1. Mushroom Trial – House 18 vs House 20 (UK, 2025)

### 1.1. Trial overview

Objective:  
Assess the impact of the Ilimex Flufence air sterilisation system on yield, production cycle time, and operational stability in a commercial mushroom facility.

Design summary (high level):  

- Two houses in the same site were compared:
  - House 18: Ilimex Flufence system installed (treatment).
  - House 20: No Ilimex system (control).
- Multiple full production cycles were run in both houses under normal commercial conditions.
- Key controllable factors (substrate supply, growing regime, farm management) were kept consistent between houses as far as practical.

Microbiological / pathogen outcomes (sequencing, etc.) are still pending or evolving. Current conclusions focus mainly on yield, cycle time and operational behaviour.

### 1.2. Headline operational findings (current working interpretation)

Important: these are **working interpretations**, not final audited results. They may be refined as more cycles complete and lab work is finalised.

- Yield and production:
  - The Ilimex house (House 18) showed a trend towards higher total annual output compared with the control house (House 20).
  - Early analysis suggests that an Ilimex-equipped house may enable additional full production cycles per year by shortening effective cycle time and/or reducing unplanned disruption.
  - One working assumption under review is that approximately two extra full cycles per year could be enabled compared with the baseline, subject to confirmation.

- Revenue equivalence (illustrative, not a guarantee):
  - For internal modelling, an example scenario has used:
    - Additional output on the order of tens of thousands of pounds of mushrooms per house per year.
    - A typical wholesale value of about £1.20 per lb in the UK market.
  - This leads to an **illustrative** uplift on the order of tens of thousands of pounds of revenue per house per year (for example around £80k–£90k), depending on final yield numbers and market price.
  - These figures are for internal discussion and should always be presented externally as indicative and site-specific, not guaranteed.

- Substrate and efficiency:
  - Cleaner, more stable growing conditions may reduce waste or suboptimal flushes, and may be associated with modest substrate savings.
  - Any substrate saving estimates should be clearly presented as working assumptions only, and must be updated when more robust data is available.

- Environmental stability and operations:
  - The Ilimex house was observed to have a more stable growing environment, with fewer extreme deviations in conditions.
  - Farm feedback indicated that the Ilimex house felt “easier to manage”, with fewer interruptions to normal production routines.
  - The working hypothesis is that reduced airborne pathogen and contaminant load leads to a less stressful environment for the crop, supporting more consistent yield and quality.

### 1.3. Caveats and limitations

- Results are from a single site and a limited number of cycles. They should not be treated as guaranteed performance across all farms.
- Microbiological and sequencing data are still being processed and may refine or adjust current interpretations.
- External communication must:
  - Avoid absolute claims.
  - Use language such as “trend”, “indications”, “early results”, “working hypothesis”.
  - Emphasise that performance is site-specific and that more data will be gathered across multiple houses and farms.

### 1.4. How IlimexBot should talk about this trial

- Always describe this as an **early commercial trial** comparing one Ilimex house with a control house on the same site.
- Focus on:
  - The concept: cleaner air, more stable growing conditions, potential for extra cycles and more consistent yield.
  - The fact that lab data and further replication are in progress.
- Use non-absolute language:
  - “Early results suggest…”
  - “We have seen indications that…”
  - “Our working hypothesis is that a cleaner growing environment reduces stress and supports yield and quality.”
- When asked for numbers:
  - Be clear that any figures are based on internal working assumptions and are **illustrative**, not guaranteed.
  - Remind users that outcomes depend on site conditions, management, and integration details.

## 2. Poultry Context – Design Intent and Early Position (Broilers, Layers, Breeders)

### 2.1. Overall concept

For poultry, Ilimex systems are designed to work alongside the existing ventilation setup rather than replace it. The purpose of the system is to reduce airborne pathogen load in the house air, helping to create a cleaner and more stable environment for the birds.

Key ideas:

- Ilimex units treat air within the house or along key airflow paths. They do not take over the role of mechanical ventilation or environmental control.
- Designs are based on house volume, airflow patterns, target ventilation rates and where the main air streams move through the building.
- Systems are intended to be compatible with common poultry housing types such as broiler houses, layer houses and breeder houses, including tunnel-ventilated and cross-flow configurations.

The goal is to support better bird health and performance by reducing airborne challenge, but all outcomes remain site-specific and depend on many factors.

### 2.2. Broilers (meat birds)

For broiler houses, typical characteristics include relatively high stocking densities, strong ventilation rates and a focus on rapid growth cycles. Airborne pathogens and dust loads can be significant, especially at later stages of the cycle when birds are larger.

Ilimex systems for broilers are expected to:

- Integrate with existing ventilation (tunnel, cross-flow or mixed).
- Be positioned so treated air is distributed along the main air paths in the house.
- Be configured to operate continuously or according to agreed duty cycles, depending on the site’s electrical and operational requirements.

As of this version of the context, detailed quantified broiler trial data is still to be gathered. All comments should be framed as concept-level and subject to confirmation from future trials and engineering designs.

### 2.3. Layers and breeders

Layer and breeder operations have different housing and management patterns compared with broilers. Houses may be multi-tier, enriched, or use different stocking densities and airflows.

Ilimex’s design principles carry across:

- Work with the existing ventilation design.
- Focus on treating air in the areas where birds are present and where air mixes most strongly.
- Adapt the number and placement of units based on house volume and air patterns.

Specific trial outcomes for layers and breeders will be added as evidence is gathered. Until then, IlimexBot should describe the concept in cautious terms and avoid implying that results for one poultry segment automatically apply to another.

### 2.4. How IlimexBot should talk about poultry

When asked about poultry:

- Explain that we design systems to work with existing house ventilation and that we treat air to reduce airborne pathogen load.
- Make it clear that design depends on house volume, ventilation type and practical installation considerations.
- Avoid giving exact numbers of units or performance figures unless explicit rules are provided later.
- Emphasise that detailed trial data will be integrated as it becomes available, and that current statements are based on design intent and general principles rather than completed multi-site poultry trials.
- Encourage the user to share house details and, if appropriate, offer to pass information to the Ilimex team for site-specific review.

### 2.5. Future Poultry Trials – Position and Workflow

Ilimex intends to run structured poultry trials with selected partners to generate robust, multi-cycle data on performance, operational impact and integration with commercial production systems. These trials may involve broiler, layer or breeder houses, with details determined by partner integrators and farm sites.

Key points:

- Trial programmes are expected to be phased, starting with a small number of carefully selected sites.
- Selection will consider factors such as integrator or processor relationships, house type and size, baseline performance data, and willingness to share operational results.
- Trial objectives are likely to include environmental stability, bird health indicators, operational continuity and economic outcomes, but exact metrics will be defined with partners.

What IlimexBot should say about poultry trials:

- Make it clear that poultry trials are planned or may be in early stages, and that detailed results are not yet fully available.
- Avoid promising trial places or implying that a site is guaranteed to be included.
- Emphasise that interest is welcome and that the Ilimex team will prioritise sites based on strategic fit and technical suitability.

Information to collect from interested poultry sites:

- Farm or company name and contact details.
- Location and region.
- Poultry type (broilers, layers, breeders).
- Typical flock size per house and number of houses on site.
- Basic description of ventilation type (for example tunnel, cross-flow, mixed).
- The integrator or processor they supply to, if applicable.
- Whether they are enquiring about:
  - Participation in a structured trial, or
  - A standalone commercial installation outside of trials.

IlimexBot should pass these enquiries to the Ilimex team via the agreed handover mechanism, making clear in its wording that inclusion in a trial cannot be guaranteed and depends on technical and strategic review.

## 3. Pig Environment Context – Early Position and System Design Principles

### 3.1. Overview

Pig housing environments often contain elevated levels of airborne pathogens, dust, aerosols and ammonia, all of which can contribute to respiratory stress and disease transmission. Ilimex systems for pig units are designed to support better environmental stability by reducing airborne pathogen load within the house air. As with all livestock segments, the Ilimex system does not replace ventilation. It works alongside the existing housing and airflow design.

### 3.2. Housing types and airflow characteristics

Pig houses vary significantly by production stage, including farrowing units, weaner units, grower/finisher sheds and gilt development units. Each has different stocking densities, ventilation requirements and airflow dynamics.

Typical considerations:

- Pig environments are usually warm and humid, with high organic dust content.
- Airflow can be mechanically driven, naturally assisted, or a hybrid.
- Respiratory load and environmental stress can accumulate in certain housing zones, especially in older or high-density buildings.
- Disease pressure often increases during colder months when ventilation rates are lower.

These factors make air-quality stabilisation and pathogen-load reduction potentially valuable, but results will always be site-specific.

### 3.3. Ilimex design principles for pig units

Across pig production stages, Ilimex systems apply the same high-level principles:

- Treat the air within the occupied space or along the main airflow paths.
- Work in harmony with existing fans and inlets, not replace them.
- Design from first principles: house volume, airflow direction, air exchange patterns and practical mounting points.
- Aim to create a cleaner, more stable atmospheric environment for pigs, reducing airborne challenge in combination with good husbandry and ventilation management.

Unit placement normally considers:

- The predominant airflow direction inside the shed.
- Recirculation zones where air tends to stagnate.
- Height and spacing required for safe and effective distribution of sterilised air.
- Dust load and pre-filtration considerations, depending on site design.

### 3.4. Current evidence position

As of this version of the context, Ilimex pig trials are in planning or early-stage preparation. No multi-cycle datasets are available yet, and no quantified performance metrics should be implied.

Therefore:

- All statements about pigs should be framed as design intent.
- Do not imply that results from poultry or mushrooms translate automatically to pigs.
- Avoid giving numbers, percentages, uplift projections or cycle-time effects.
- Emphasise that site-specific engineering review is required.

### 3.5. How IlimexBot should answer pig-related questions

When the user asks about pigs:

- Explain that Ilimex systems are intended to support better environmental stability by reducing airborne pathogen load.
- Make it clear that the approach depends on the house type, production stage, ventilation pattern and operational constraints.
- Encourage the user to provide house dimensions and ventilation information for a high-level discussion.
- Offer lead-capture next steps for technical review.
- Make clear that quantified results will be added once trials are complete.

This section should be updated when real pig-house trial data is available.
